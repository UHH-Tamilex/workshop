# Workshop 1: The one where we transcribe manuscripts

In this first workshop, we will each be transcribing (at least) one witness of poem 4 from the _Akanāṉūṟu_. The witnesses may be manuscripts in palm-leaf or paper, printed editions, or quotations in other works.

A reference text, as edited and translated by Eva Wilden in 2018, is available in [TEI XML format](https://uhh-tamilex.github.io/corpus/Akananuru/AN4.xml).
