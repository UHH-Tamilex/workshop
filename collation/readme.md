# Workshop 2, the one where we automagically collate transcriptions

In this second workshop, we will practice performing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which aligns two sequences, on pencil and paper. We will discuss various strategies for tokenizing and normalizing a text, as well as scoring the resulting alignment.
