# Computational Philology workshop, summer 2023

### Workshop 1, the one where we [transcribe](transcription/) manuscripts

In the first workshop, we will focus on making TEI XML transcriptions of manuscripts, and we will discuss conventions and levels of diplomacy.

### Workshop 2, the one where we automagically [collate](collation/) transcriptions

In this second workshop, we will learn an algorithm for comparing two (or more) versions of the same text, and then we will apply it to the transcriptions we made.

### Workshop 3, the one where we infer a [stemma](stemma/)

In this third workshop, we will take our collations and use tools developed in the biological sciences to create a phylogenetic tree (i.e., a stemma) representing the transmission history of the text. Then, we will learn an algorithm to create a reconstruction of (a) critical text(s). We will compare this algorithm to “Lachmann's method.”

### Workshop 4, the one where we make a [dictionary](dictionary/)

In this final workshop, we will take our critical text and add word splits and other lexical data, and see how this can be connected to the critical work on textual transmission that we did previously.
